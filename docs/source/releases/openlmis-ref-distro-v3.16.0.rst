New Features
============
The OpenLMIS community focused on the following work in version 3.16.0:

**Data import from UI**-Functionality allows users to import system data from UI. Before, if a user wanted to import system data i.e. names of all currently stocked products, it had to be done by database. Functionality will be assigned to a specific role - Administrator.
**Bug fixes**
Chrome API fixes - the most critical part of this patch release. These changes were introduced due to the recent Chrome release which API changes. Now users are able to use OpenLMIS properly on Chrome browser
Approve buttons not visible when trying to approve requisition - we've fixed the problem with requisition service. There was a problem with the approve button which wasn't visible for users with proper permissions.
Stock Out Days was not showing the proper values even after its recent release. Currently it's fixed and values are properly calculated.


    Reference the `3.16 epics <https://openlmis.atlassian.net/issues/?filter=20614&jql=issuetype%20%3D%20Epic%20AND%20status%20in%20(Done%2C%20%22In%20Progress%22)%20AND%20fixVersion%20%3D%203.15%20ORDER%20BY%20created%20DESC>`_ for more details.

Changes to Existing Functionality
=================================

See `all 3.16 issues tagged 'UIChange' in Jira <https://openlmis.atlassian.net/issues/?jql=status%3DDone%20AND%20project%3DOLMIS%20AND%20fixVersion%3D3.15%20and%20type!%3DTest%20and%20type!%3DEpic%20and%20labels%20IN%20(UIChange)%20ORDER%20BY%20type%20ASC%2C%20priority%20DESC%2C%20key%20ASC>`_.

API Changes
===========

API changes can be found in each service CHANGELOG.md file, found in the root directory of the service repository.

Performance
========================

The performance of version 3.16 is similar to 3.15 with some modest improvements. Performance remains a high priority for the OpenLMIS community and we continue to review the overall performance picture and look for opportunities for improvements.

OpenLMIS conducted manual performance tests of the same user workflows with the same test data we used in testing v3.2.1 to establish that last-mile performance characteristics have been retained at a minimum. For details on the test results and process, please see `this wiki page <https://openlmis.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/OP/pages/116949318/Performance+Metrics>`_.

The following chart displays the UI loading times in seconds for 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, and 3.13 using the same test data.


Test Coverage
=============

OpenLMIS 3.16.0 was tested using the established OpenLMIS Release Candidate process.  As part of this process, full manual test cycles were executed for each release candidate published. Any critical or blocker bugs found during the release candidate were resolved in a bug fix cycle with a full manual test cycle executed before releasing the final version 3.15.0. Manual tests were conducted using a set of 97 QAlity tests tracked in Jira and 7 manual tests for reporting. For more details about test executions and bugs found for this release please see `the 3.15 QA Release and Bug Triage wiki page <https://openlmis.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/OP/pages/2320269316/The+3.15+Regression+and+Release+Candidate+Test+Plan>`_.
