# OpenLMIS Reporting Stack

## Deploying to a Server
1. *Prerequisite:* You should first [deploy OpenLMIS](../README.md). OpenLMIS and the reporting stack must run on separate (virtual) machines. Your OpenLMIS instance should have HTTPS enabled to connect to the reporting stack.

2. *Prerequisite:* You should have a server with two domain names pointing to it, one for Superset and one for NiFi (e.g. `nifi.foo.openlmis.org` and `superset.foo.openlmis.org`). Ports 80 and 443 should be open on the server.

3. Configure OpenLMIS to authenticate with the reporting stack's components. If your OpenLMIS instance is using the `demo-data` spring profile, this is already setup.
  You need two users in OpenLMIS: one for Superset and one for NiFi. The instructions below describe how to set up these users ("OAuth User for Superset" and "OpenLMIS user with all permissions for Superset").

4. From this directory (`openlmis-ref-distro/reporting/`) on the server, copy and configure your settings.
  ```
  $ cp settings-sample.env settings.env
  ```
  * Edit `settings.env` to match your setup. Despite generating the passwords, you will likely need to change
   `VIRTUAL_HOST`, `TRUSTED_HOSTNAME`, `OL_BASE_URL` (to point to OpenLMIS) and `NIFI_DOMAIN_NAME` and `SUPERSET_DOMAIN_NAME` (which should point to the reporting stack).
  Details on all the environment variables are below.

5. Bring up the reporting stack by running [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) on the server:
  ```sh
  docker-compose up --build -d
  ```
  * You might, at times, want to take down the stack including all the created volumes. We recommend you do this if you ever change configurations in either the [./db](./db) or [./config](./config) directories:

  ```sh
  docker-compose down -v
  ```

6. The Superset webapp should now be running on your server. From your local browser, navigate to your Superset domain. You should be presented with a sign-in screen:
  <img src="./superset-login.png" alt="Superset sign-in screen, with the first provider button outlined in red" width="300px"/>

7. Click the arrow (outlined in red above) to select OpenLMIS OAuth provider. Then, click the "Sign In" button. Enter the credentials for your OpenLMIS user for Superset. On the next page, approve all the requested permissions. Now, when you navigate to the Superset domain, a dashboard should populate with data from your OpenLMIS instance.

8.  If you have an OpenLMIS user with the proper permissions, you can also log in to OpenLMIS and navigate to `https://<OpenLMIS Domain>/#!/reports/list` and then select a report that uses the reporting stack (e.g. stockouts) to access Superset from OpenLMIS. This will require authorizing Superset by following the on-screen instructions.

9. You should be able to access NiFi by navigating to the `NIFI_DOMAIN_NAME`, if you set it up.

## Upgrading Superset to a new version

Upgrading Superset to new version consist of two steps:
1. Updating configuration volume with latest Superset configuration and customization files.
1. Building and starting a new Docker image with the upgraded version.

##### Updating configuration volume

The `./upgrade-superset-config.sh` script can be used to update the configuration volume in one go. 
It must be executed on the Superset's Docker host system. 
The scripts starts a 'dummy' container linked ot the config volume, and copies (with override) the new content
of `./config/services/superset`.

##### Running new Docker image

There are not special considerations. 
Start and build the Docker image included in this project as described in **Deploying to a Server** section.

## OAuth User for Superset

In order to use user authentication in Superset by an OpenLMIS instance we need to create additional user in OpenLMIS.
It is the specific user with `authorizedGrantTypes` set to `authorization_code`

Example of a SQL statement creating that user (superset:changeme):
```
INSERT INTO auth.oauth_client_details (clientId,authorities,authorizedGrantTypes,clientSecret,"scope")
VALUES ('superset','TRUSTED_CLIENT','authorization_code','changeme','read,write');
```

Don't forget to set newly created user's credentials in settings.env. Example:
```
OL_SUPERSET_USER=superset
OL_SUPERSET_PASSWORD=changeme
```

## OpenLMIS user with all permissions for Superset

The ETL process conducted via NiFi requires a user which has all permissions (all program + supervisory node pairs) to read data from all requisitions in the system. It should not be a simple admin, because sometime it doesn't has all permissions (eg. for requisitions)

The simplest way to create that user is using the https://github.com/OpenLMIS/openlmis-refdata-seed tool.

Note: Created user must have an email address.


Don't forget to set newly created user's credentials in settings.env. Example:
```
OL_ADMIN_USERNAME=administrator
OL_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password
```

## Environment variables

The environment variables in `settings.env` have to be set to successfully run the reporting stack.
The sample settings file can be found [here](settings-sample.env). The sample file contains description of each field.

## Running Locally

* While it is possible to run the reporting stack locally, it is not entirely supported, and you cannot run both the reporting stack and OpenLMIS locally at the same time.
* It's easiest to access superset and nifi by leaving `.env` alone, and adding
    entries to our host's `/etc/hosts` file:
    ```
    127.0.0.1   nifi.local superset.local
    ```

### Running Setup Without Scalyr

There are some cases (when running on a dev machine, for instance) where you would prefer to spin-up the stack without the Scalyr container running. To do that, run docker-compose this way:

```sh
docker-compose up --build -d --scale scalyr=0
```
